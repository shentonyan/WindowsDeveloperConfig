Your dev environment should help you ship, not become another project to debug. Try the new Windows developer configuration and spend less time setting up, more time building something awesome.  

## 🎯 Pick your setup

Three developer setups live in this repo. Pick the one that matches what you want:

| You want... | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| A complete dev workstation: tools, OS settings, WSL, and terminal. One command, restarts once. | [Windows Dev Config](#%EF%B8%8F-windows-dev-config) |
| A polished WSL shell: zsh/bash, Starship, CLI tools, and a themed terminal profile. Interactive or unattended. | [WSL Comfort](#-wsl-comfort) |
| A single language toolchain: Node, Python, SQL, PowerShell, .NET, Rust, Go, Java, PHP, WinForms, or WinUI 3. One command each. | [Workloads](#-single-language-workloads) |

## 🖥️ Windows Dev Config

*Turns a fresh Windows 11 box into a clean, distraction-free dev workstation in one shot.*

A set of PowerShell scripts that installs dev tools, applies opinionated Windows settings, and sets up WSL + Ubuntu through the required reboot. Nothing to clone, nothing to install first. Idempotent, so it's safe to re-run on an existing machine.

Open any PowerShell window — elevated or not — and run:

### Standard
```powershell
irm https://aka.ms/devconfig/standard/setup.ps1 | iex
```

### Full experience
```powershell
irm https://aka.ms/devconfig/full/setup.ps1 | iex
```

> ⚠️ **It will restart your machine, once.** Enabling WSL needs a Windows optional feature that requires a restart. You get a 10-second warning, and a scheduled task resumes setup after you sign back in and accept the UAC prompt. **Save your work before you start.**

<details>
<summary><strong>What you get</strong></summary>

### Standard Experience
- **Dev tools:** Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7, Git, GitHub CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code, .NET SDK 10, Python 3.14 + uv, Node.js LTS + nvm, Coreutils for Windows, Windows App CLI, Oh My Posh, and PowerToys.
- **Terminal:** PowerShell 7 as the default profile, Oh My Posh in your prompt, Cascadia Mono NF as the default font, and a GitHub Copilot profile in the dropdown.
- **Windows settings:** Dark theme, long paths, File Explorer defaults, and Start menu settings
- **WSL:** WSL platform + Ubuntu, including the restart and the automatic resume afterwards.

### Full
- **Everything from standard**
- **Windows settings:** Developer Mode, Sudo, widgets off, Edge policies, Do Not Disturb, and additional Search/System Tray settings
- **Remote Desktop:** Enabled (the Windows Firewall rule is not opened)

## 🐧 WSL Comfort

*Also known as Comfort Shell. An interactive setup for a polished Windows + WSL shell environment.*

WSL Comfort stands apart. It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, and lets you pick and choose individual components. The Windows side handles WSL, the distro, the Cascadia Code Nerd Font, and a themed Windows Terminal profile. The Linux side runs inside the distro and configures the shell itself.

```powershell
.\wsl-comfort\install.ps1
```

Interactive by default. Use `-NonInteractive` for unattended runs; the bootstrap also takes `--minimal` for a smaller setup. The Linux half is standalone, so you can copy `comfort-shell-bootstrap.sh` into any Ubuntu WSL distro and run it directly.

<details>
<summary><strong>What you can pick</strong></summary>

- Your choice of shell: **zsh** or **bash**.
- Optional **Starship** prompt.
- Optional modern CLI tools: `fzf`, `rg`, `fd`, `bat`, `eza`, `zoxide`, `jq`.
- Optional clipboard and `open` shims (`pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, `open`).
- Optional **Homebrew**.
- Optional Git defaults.
- A themed **Windows Terminal** profile using Cascadia Code Nerd Font.

</details>

## 🧪 Single-language workloads

Just want one toolchain? Pick a row. Each workload ships a `configuration.winget` file plus a matching `install.ps1` shim that applies it and refreshes PATH in the current session. 

Most of the single-language workloads use [`winget configure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/configure). If you've never used it before, enable it once:

```powershell
winget configure --enable
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `winget` is being invoked from a **non-elevated** environment, the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable ([aka.ms/vcredist](https://aka.ms/vcredist)) must also be installed — without it `winget configure` fails with an internal error. Install it once with the command for your machine's architecture:
>
> ```powershell
> # x64:
> winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64
>
> # ARM64:
> winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.arm64
> ```

If that fails or `winget configure` is still not recognized, see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting). Windows Dev Config doesn't use `winget configure` and needs none of this.

Want the PATH refresh in your current shell? Use the matching shim instead of calling `winget configure` directly:

```powershell
.\Workloads\python\install.ps1
```

> **Heads up:** WinForms, WinUI 3, and Rust (which needs the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools) pull down several gigabytes of Visual Studio components. Fine on a real workstation, painful on a small VM.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>"Unrecognized command: configure"</strong></summary>

Run `winget configure --enable`. If `winget configure` is still not recognized after that, [`Workloads/_common/assert-winget-configure.ps1`](./Workloads/_common/assert-winget-configure.ps1) tells you whether App Installer is too old, policy has disabled configuration, or something else needs fixing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>winget configure</code> fails with "internal error" / error code <code>-2146233079</code></strong></summary>

This usually means the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is missing — `winget configure` depends on it when invoked from a non-elevated environment. Install it once with the command for your architecture, then re-run:

```powershell
# x64:
winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64

# ARM64:
winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.arm64
```

See [aka.ms/vcredist](https://aka.ms/vcredist) for the standalone installer. The repo's [`Workloads/_common/enable-winget-configure.ps1`](./Workloads/_common/enable-winget-configure.ps1) script also installs it automatically as part of enabling `winget configure`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A workload says it succeeded but <code>python</code> / <code>node</code> / the tool isn't on PATH</strong></summary>

Open a new terminal, or run the matching `install.ps1` shim to refresh PATH in the current session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows Dev Config rebooted the machine and looks stuck</strong></summary>

It registered a scheduled task named `WindowsDevConfigResume`, so the run picks itself back up about 30 seconds after you sign back in. A window opens on its own and finishes the WSL setup. If nothing appears after a couple of minutes, run the one-liner again — it's safe to re-run and skips everything already done. More detail in [`windows-dev-config/README.md`](./src/windows-dev-config/README.md#troubleshooting).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Comfort Shell bootstrap fails because WSL is missing</strong></summary>

Run `.\wsl-comfort\install.ps1` on the Windows side instead. It installs WSL first.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>WSL install fails with <code>wsl --install ... failed with exit code -1</code></strong></summary>

WSL needs hardware virtualization available to the OS. Two common root causes:

- **On bare metal:** virtualization (VT-x / AMD-V) is disabled in BIOS/UEFI. Reboot into firmware settings, enable it, save, and reboot back into Windows. The exact label varies by vendor — check your motherboard or laptop manufacturer's documentation if you can't find it.
- **Inside a VM:** the host hasn't exposed nested virtualization to the guest. For a Hyper-V host, run this from an elevated PowerShell session **on the host** (with the guest VM powered off):

  ```powershell
  Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VM_NAME> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
  ```

  Other hypervisors have their own equivalent settings — check your hypervisor's documentation.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, doc fixes, new workloads, voice-and-tone tweaks. Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md), then read [`src/docs/development.md`](./src/docs/development.md) for the CI matrix, the "how to add a language" walkthrough, and how the sign pipeline works.

> **Note on the repo layout:** the [`src/`](./src/) tree is the source of truth. The top-level `windows-dev-config/`, `Workloads/`, and `wsl-comfort/` folders are Authenticode-signed release copies regenerated by the sign pipeline, so please don't edit them directly. Full details in [`src/docs/development.md`](./src/docs/development.md#repo-layout-signed-vs-source).

The single source of truth for every flow (paths, build/run commands, ids, language metadata) is [`src/manifest.yml`](./src/manifest.yml). The Command Palette extension, the CI harness, and the per-flow shims all read from it, so keep it in sync when you add or rename a flow.
